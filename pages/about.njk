My name is Oussama Ben Guirat, I'm living in Paris and currently I'm finishing a master's degree in Corporate & Market Finance at Panthéon-Assas University.
As long as I can remember, I’ve always been attracted by finance and economic issues. That’s why I want to become an investment banker. Throughout the years, I have developed a keen attitude to constantly learn new stuff related to finance such as fund raising, equity investment or mergers & acquisitions. Back to my early years at college, I’ve managed a crypto-assets wallet; more recently, I started to handle a stock market portfolio. According to me, I’ve got strong analytical and leaderships skills as well as problem solving and communication skills.
Aside from studying at college, I’m a huge fan of computing. Being self-taught in this field has been an opportunity because it allows me to approach the subject differently. I was lucky enough to work on many different freelance projects. Through my journey into coding I collected a lot of knowledge about many subjects.
Eventually, being constantly looking for new challenges, I started to learn Dutch (Ja, ik spreek Nederlands !!!).
